 * @file    IasAvbVideoReceiver.hpp
 * @brief   Definition of the video receiver.
 * @details The video receiver is created by a video client application that uses the video bridge library to connect
 *          to the AVB Streamhandler. Therefore it has to pass a receiver role name. This role name is used as
 *          the name for the underlying data exchange mechanism (e.g. shared memory) and is basically the name of
 *          the video stream handled by this receiver instance.
 *          To wait for video data packets coming from the AVB stack a receiver thread is created. In this thread
 *          a callback method is called which has to be registered by the client. By using this method the received
 *          data is passed to the client video application.
